# Getting Started

The Video Interaction product focuses on one-to-one video calls where an ‘Agent’ (employee of a company) is engaging with a ‘Guest’ (usually a customer or prospect).

The [Agent Portal](https://video-agent.8x8.com) (<https://video-agent.8x8.com/>) allows Agents to start or receive calls. <br>
To start a call, an Agent can send an SMS invite to any phone number and input a call reference. <br>

A link can also be embedded in a website, email, or mobile app, for the Guest to start a call. In this case, the incoming call (video interaction request from customer) will be routed to an available Agent.

The following APIs are divided into two parts:

**Management API**, allowing you to create tokens, rooms and assign Agents. <br>

**Reporting API**, allowing you to get all the information on previous calls and to retrieve images that were sent during the chat conversation.

To get access to Video Interaction and test the API, please reach out to [CPaaS sales team](mailto:cpaas-sales@8x8.com) (mailto:cpaas-sales@8x8.com).
