# RCS

RCS Business Messaging (RBM) is designed to enable rich, interactive communication between businesses and consumers—all within the default messaging app on Android devices.

It’s powered by Rich Communication Services (RCS), a protocol developed by Google and mobile carriers to modernise texting.

**Key Features:**  

• Branded messages with your business name, logo, and verified status.  

• Rich media support: Send high-quality images, videos, carousels, and file attachments.  

• Interactive messaging: Use buttons for calls, maps, website links, quick replies, and more.  

• Delivery and read receipts: Know when messages are delivered and seen.  

• SMS fallback: Automatically sends as SMS when RCS is unavailable on the device.

**Why It’s Valuable for Businesses:** • Drives higher engagement than traditional SMS with app-like experiences.  

• Builds trust and authenticity through verified branding.  

• Supports two-way conversations (ideal for updates, promotions, reminders, and support).
