# User management

The user management feature allows you to manage users from adding, deleting, disabling and giving access to Connect menus and features.

## Inviting or adding a new user on Connect

*(This assumes the user is already logged in and has "user management" access or with admin level privileges)*

1. Go to the left navigation menu and click "Users". Alternatively, you can also click the "gear" icon on the top right menu just beside your profile icon and select "User management".

Take note that some products like Chat Apps, Automation, Voice, Video are not enabled by default because these are premium products.
